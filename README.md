# sign_recognition
Our Sign Language Recognition System uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect and interpret hand gestures in real time. It identifies gestures like “Okay,” “Victory,” “Stop,” and “Dislike” with high accuracy. The system features real-time tracking, voice output, and a user-friendly interface, making gesture communication seamless.
